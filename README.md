# NY-Subway: Analysis of the NY subway system
## MOTIVATION: 
### A growing trend in the food and hospitatlity service is operating a food-truck. However, despite the low barrier to entry, they are plagued by a high turnover rate of greater than 80% and uncertain profitability. Nonetheless, they hold great promise for first-time entrepreneurs. 
## CHALLENGE: 
### The challenge is to provide food-truck owners with a way to synchronize their locations throughout NY city each day of the week. We wish maximize the chance of a food-truck owner succeeding in his/her endeavor by providing them with a tool that can help maximize their ROI. Alternatively, we can facilitate diversification as these food-truck owners can help event organizers and promotors distribute flyers and information packages since they already have a presence in a location with high traffic.
## GOAL:
### The goal is to develop an app that will analyze the NY subway turnstile data to determine the entry and exit locations of the NY subway system with the most crowd each day of the week. In this way, food-truck owners will be equipped with enough information to plan well ahead of schedule. Primarily, the app will help them in 
    (a) Planning in advance to locate/reserve a parking spot
    (b) Planning for which time of the day to target, so meals are prepared accordingly. For example, if an owner decides to cater to morning commuters, he/she can tailor their menu for breakfast items. This helps them to significantly cut down on menu planning and preparation time.
    (c) Maximizing ROI by having a presence in locations with highest foot traffic. additionally, by including demographic data, the app can help food-truck operators in targeting people most likely to grab a meal on-the-go.
    (d) Add additional sources of income by increasing their potential to partner with event organizers and promoters for mutual benefit.
